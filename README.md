# football-project

This repo contains information regarding a project I completed using Skill Corners (https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata) open sourced football player coordinate data. The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts what tactical line a player belongs to based on their coordinate data.

The files in this repo are as follows:

- **exploratory-analysis**: Supporting code to help me better understand the data
- **helper-functions**: Supporting functions to assist me in the modeling process
- **model-building**: The produciton model building script
- **model-exploration**: Testing out different models to determine which model to utilize
- **model-results**: The data I used to build my model along with the model predictions
- **presentation**: A PowerPoint explaining my project and the results of the model
- **tactical-model**: The model as a RDS file
